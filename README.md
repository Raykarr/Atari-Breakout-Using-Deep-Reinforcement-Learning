## Description
Atari Breakout is a classic arcade game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks at the top of the screen. The goal is to break as many bricks as possible while preventing the ball from falling below the paddle.

## Problem Description
This project aims to apply deep reinforcement learning techniques to master the Atari Breakout game. The README provides an overview of the problem, environment, agent, method description, results, and conclusions.

## Environment and Agent Description

### Markov Decision Process (MDP) Formulation
- **States (S):** Represented by stacks of the last four frames from the game.
- **Actions (A):** Discrete actions including moving the paddle left, moving it right, or firing the ball.
- **Objective:** Maximize cumulative reward by breaking bricks and preventing the ball from falling.

### Model
- **Model Type:** Model-free approach
- **Discount Factor (γ):** 0.99
- **Output Layer:** Four neurons representing Q-values for each action.

### Rewards (R)
- +1 for each brick broken by the ball
- 0 for all other actions

### Transitions (T)
- Deterministic transitions governed by game physics.

### Policy (π)
- ε-greedy strategy with ε initially set to 1 and decaying to 0.1 over 1,000,000 frames.

## Method Description

### Components
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** ε-greedy strategy
- **Learning Algorithm:** DQN with Adam optimizer, learning rate of 0.00025, and Huber loss function.
- **Experience Replay:** Buffer stores up to 100,000 past experiences.
- **Target Network:** Weights updated every 10,000 steps.

### Flowchart
1. Initialize environment and Q-network.
2. Play episodes, collecting experiences.
3. Store experiences in replay buffer.
4. Sample batches for training.
5. Update Q-network using gradient descent.
6. Periodically update target Q-network.
7. Repeat until convergence or max episodes reached.

## Results

### Goal
- Achieve a running reward of 40 or higher.

### Monitoring
- Script logs running reward and episode count periodically.

### Achievements
- Agent achieves running reward of over 40, indicating successful learning and mastery of the game environment.

## Conclusion
The Deep Q-Network algorithm effectively learns to play Atari Breakout, showcasing the power of reinforcement learning in mastering complex tasks in diverse environments.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
